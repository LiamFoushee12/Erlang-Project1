# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}
There are two files. One for the server and one for the user. The server allows users to connect to it and send messages/communicate to each other.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with Erlang, and to play around with a server. Both of those things I haven't had much experience with. It also just sounded like 
an interesting idea and like it would be fun to make.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
